## Implementation Directory
This is the main implementation directory.
Most of the rest are auto populated by flutter and are rarely touched unless specific permissions or properties need to be set for specific targets.

## Layout
|- app_state_model.dart - the main application state data structure shared by all screens
|- location_row_item.dart - the widget that paints an individual location row
|- main.dart - the entry point to run the app
