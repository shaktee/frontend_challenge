## Getting Started

The main implementation resides under `lib/`. See [lib/README.md](lib/README.md) for details.

## Running the app
Once you install `flutter`, at the top of this directory, type
```
flutter run
```
and select a target. Selecting a local (macos, windows, linux, ios, android) target will allow you to use persistent state in the application. Selecting `chrome` as the web app will not support persistent state.

## Flutter resources
A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
